# Bank Loan Analysis


### Project Overview

In this project, Power BI and SQL were used to analyze a dataset of 33.2K bank loan applications. The primary goal was to identify trends in loan issuance, distinguish between good and bad loans, and evaluate key financial metrics such as total funded/received amounts, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios (DTI).
### Tools

-SQL Server - Data Analysis

-PowerBI - Creating reports

### DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
"In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
#### Steps - followed
1.	Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period
2.	Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial
3.	Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment
4.	Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans
5.	Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health

### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s
In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria
